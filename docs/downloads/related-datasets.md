## The OpenAIRE LOD dataset

The OpenAIRE Linked Open Data (LOD) Services and their integration with the OpenAIRE information space have been released as a beta version. The LOD exporting process started with a specification of the OpenAIRE data model as an RDF vocabulary, and then mapping of the OpenAIRE data to the graph-based RDF data model. To interlink the OpenAIRE data with related data on the Web, we have identified a list of potential datasets to interlinked with, including the DBpedia dataset extracted from Wikipedia and the publication databases DBLP and CiteSeer.
Please refer [here](http://lod.openaire.eu/documentation) for more details on the LOD documentation.
