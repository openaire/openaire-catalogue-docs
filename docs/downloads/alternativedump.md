# Dump of Research Communities/Infrastructure and products related to projects

The dump for Research Communities/Infrastructure and products related to projects do not follow the model used to dump the whole graph.
The main differences are:

 * only research products are dumped (no relations, and entities different from results)
 * the dumped results are extended with information that can be inferred in the whole dump namely:
   * funding information if present
   * associated research community/infrastructure 
   * associated data sources 

So we have just one entity which is the [extended result](alternative-model/extendedresult.md)
