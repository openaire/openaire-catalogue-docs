# Full graph dump

You can download the full OpenAIRE Research Graph Dump as well as its schema from the following links: 

 Dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3516917
    
 Schema: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4238938

The schema used to dump this dataset mirrors  the one described in the [Data Model](../data-model).
This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
It is composed of several files so that you can download the parts you are interested into. The files are named after the entity they store (i.e. publication, dataset). Each file is at most 10GB and it is 
a tar archive containing gz files, each with one json per line.


:::note Tip!

For a visual and interactive overview of the JSON schema, we suggest to use a JSON schema viewer like [jsonschemaviewer](https://navneethg.github.io/jsonschemaviewer/) (you just need to copy the schema and then you can easily navigate through the nodes).
