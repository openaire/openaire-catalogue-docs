# Sub-graphs and other formats

In order to facilitate users, different dumps and formats are available under the Zenodo community called  [OpenAIRE Research Graph](https://zenodo.org/communities/openaire-research-graph).
In the following, you can find the list of alternative Dumps currently available:

## The OpenAIRE COVID-19 dump

 Dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6638745

 Schema: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6372977
    
 This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
    It contains metadata records of publications, research data, software and projects on the topic of Corona Virus and COVID-19. 
This dump is part of the activities of OpenAIRE to support the fight against COVID-19 together with the OpenAIRE COVID-19 Gateway. 
The dump consists of a tar archive containing gzip files with one json per line. The model of this dump differs from the one of the whole graph. 
The differences are shown in the [Alternative Model Dump](./alternativedump)

## The dump of funded products

 Dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6634431

 Schema: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6372977

 This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
It contains metadata records of research products (research literature, data, software, other types of research products) with funding 
information available in the OpenAIRE Graph. Records are grouped by funder in a dedicated archive file. Each tar archive contains 
gzip files, each with one json record per line.

## The dump of delta projects

 Dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7119633

 Schema: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5799514
  
 This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
  It contains the metadata records of projects collected by OpenAIRE in a given time frame. Usually one deposition of collected projects is done for each release of the OpenAIRE Graph
 The deposition is one tar archive containing gzip files, each with one json record per line.

## The dumps about research communities, initiatives and infrastructures

 Dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6638478

 Schema: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6372977

 This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
The dataset contains one file per community/initiative/infrastructure collaborating with OpenAIRE. Check out also their community gateways on 
 CONNECT. Each file is a tar archive containing gzip files with one json per line. The only communities/research initiative/infrastructure we dump are those visible to everyone. 

## The dump of ScholeXplorer

 Dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6338616
 
 Schema (Scholix version 3): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1120275
