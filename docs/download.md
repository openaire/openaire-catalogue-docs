# Bulk downloads

In order to facilitate users, different dumps are available. All are available under the Zenodo community called [OpenAIRE Research Graph](https://zenodo.org/communities/openaire-research-graph).
Here we provide detailed documentation about the full dump:

* JSON dump: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3516917
* JSON schema: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4238938

:::tip Tip!

For a visual and interactive overview of the JSON schema, we suggest to use a JSON schema viewer like [jsonschemaviewer](https://navneethg.github.io/jsonschemaviewer/) (you just need to copy the schema and then you can easily navigate through the nodes).
