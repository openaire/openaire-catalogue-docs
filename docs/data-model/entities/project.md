# Project

Of crucial interest to OpenAIRE is also the identification of the funders (e.g. European Commission, WellcomeTrust, FCT Portugal, NWO The Netherlands) that co-funded the projects that have led to a given result. Projects are characterized by a list of funding streams (e.g. FP7, H2020 for the EC), which identify the strands of fundings. Funding streams can be nested to form a tree of sub-funding streams.
