# Community (Initiative)

Research communities and research initiatives are intended as groups of people with a common research intent and can be of two types: ​research initiatives or ​research communities​:

* Research initiatives are intended to capture a view of the information space that is "research impact"-oriented, i.e. all products generated due to my research initiative;
* Research communities the latter “research activity” oriented, i.e. all products that may be of interest or related to my research initiative.

For example, the organizations supporting a research infrastructure fall in the first category, while the researchers involved in a discipline fall in the second.
