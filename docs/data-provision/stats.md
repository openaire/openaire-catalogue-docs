# Stats analysis

The OpenAIRE Research Graph is also processed by a pipeline for extracting the statistics and producing the charts for funders, research initiative, infrastructures, and policy makers that you can see on MONITOR. Based on the information available on the graph, OpenAIRE provides a set of indicators for monitoring the funding and research impact and the uptake of Open Science publishing practices, such as Open Access publishing of publications and datasets, availability of interlinks between research products, availability of post-print versions in institutional or thematic Open Access repositories, etc.
