# Versions & changelog


# Versioning

Our versioning policy follows the [Semantic Versioning specification](https://semver.org/). 
In our case, given a version `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we increment the:

* `MAJOR` version when the data model of the Graph changes
* `MINOR` version when the pipeline (e.g., different deduplication method, different implementation for an enrichment process) or the data sources change
* `PATCH` version when the graph data are updated


# Changelog

This section will document all notable changes for each graph version.
