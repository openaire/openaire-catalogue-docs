# Search API

The Search API allows developers to access metadata records of the OpenAIRE Graph by performing queries over research products (i.e., publications, data, software, other research products), and projects. The API is intended for metadata discovery and exploration only, hence it does not provide access to the whole information space: the number of total results returned by one query is limited to 10,000. For accessing the whole graph, developers are encouraged to use the [OpenAIRE full Graph dataset](../../downloads/full-graph).
