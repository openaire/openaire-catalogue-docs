# Stats analysis

The OpenAIRE Graph is also processed by a pipeline for extracting the statistics 
and producing the charts for funders, research initiative, research infrastructures, 
and policymakers available on [MONITOR](https://monitor.openaire.eu). 

Based on the information available on the graph, OpenAIRE provides a set of 
indicators for monitoring the funding and research impact and the uptake of 
Open Science publishing practices, such as Open Access publishing of publications 
and datasets, availability of interlinks between research products, availability 
of post-print versions in institutional or thematic Open Access repositories, etc.
