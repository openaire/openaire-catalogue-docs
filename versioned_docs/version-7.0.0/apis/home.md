# Public APIs

The OpenAIRE Graph data are accessible through various public APIs. More specifically, the following APIs are currently provided:
* Search API (an API to search for research results and projects)
* ScholeXplorer API (an API offering dataset-publication & dataset-dataset links)
* DSpace & EPrints API (an API to offer custom access to metadata for projects funded by a selection of international funders for DSpace and EPrints platforms)
* Broker API (an API to enrich metadata for repositories, publishers, and aggregators) 

It is also worth mentioning that, between 2015 and 2023 a LOD API was being provided but the respective service has been discontinued. Old LOD datasets can be found on Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/records/4587369).
