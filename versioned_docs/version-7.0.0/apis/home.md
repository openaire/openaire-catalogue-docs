# Public APIs

The OpenAIRE Graph data are accessible through various public APIs. More specifically, the following APIs are currently provided:
* [Search API](./search-api) (an API to search for research results and projects)
* [ScholeXplorer API](https://api.scholexplorer.openaire.eu/swagger-ui/index.html?urls.primaryName=Scholexplorer%20API%20V2.0) (an API offering dataset-publication & dataset-dataset links)
* [DSpace & EPrints API](./dspace-eprints-api) (an API to offer custom access to metadata for projects funded by a selection of international funders for DSpace and EPrints platforms)
* [Broker API](./broker-api) (an API to enrich metadata for repositories, publishers, and aggregators) 

It is also worth mentioning that, between 2015 and 2023 a LOD API was being provided but the respective service has been discontinued. Old LOD datasets can be found on Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/records/4587369).
